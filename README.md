MOAFTME (Mixture of Accelerated Failure Time Model Experts) is an R package for
the estimation of parameters of a survival analysis model consisting in a
mixture of experts, each of which is an accelerated failure time (AFT) model.
Estimation is performed witn an MCMC algorithm. 

This package was written as a course project. While the core is functional and
relatively well optimized in terms of speed (many parts are in C), the current
interface is rather simplistic. We are currently implementing a more
traditional "R-like" interface.
